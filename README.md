# Real-time-object-tracking-demo
This repository contains a real-time object tracking demo using OpenCV networks with webcam input. It includes implementations of multiple tracking algorithms: MIL, KCF, CSRT, DaSiamRPN, NanoTrackV2, and ViT. Additionally, Samurai is used to evaluate tracking accuracy on a recorded video in Google Colab.
